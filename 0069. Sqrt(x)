Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.


SOURCE CODE:
int mySqrt(int x) 
{
    unsigned long long int j,i=1;/*the variable cannot store negative numbers.long long int â€”a data type that allows very large positive integers*/
    while(i)
    {
        j = i*i;
        if( j >  x )
        {
            i--;
            break;
        }
        i++;     
    }
    return i;
}

OUTPUT:

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
