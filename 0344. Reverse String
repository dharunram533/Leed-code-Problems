Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

SOURCE CODE:
 void reverseString(char* s, int sSize) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = sSize - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        // Swap characters at positions left and right
        char temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;

        left++;
        right--;
    }
}

    
OUTPUT:
Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
